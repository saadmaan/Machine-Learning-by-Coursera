# Machine-Learning-by-Coursera

Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed. In the past decade, machine learning has given us self-driving cars, 
practical speech recognition, effective web search, and a vastly improved understanding of the human genome. Machine learning is so pervasive today that you probably use it 
dozens of times a day without knowing it. Many researchers also think it is the best way to make progress towards human-level AI.This course provides a broad introduction to 
machine learning, datamining, and statistical pattern recognition. Topics include: (i) Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks). 
(ii) Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning). (iii) Best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation 
process in machine learning and AI). The course also draws from numerous case studies and applications, so that learners learn how to apply learning algorithms to building 
smart robots (perception, control), text understanding (web search, anti-spam), computer vision, medical informatics, audio, database mining, and other areas.
